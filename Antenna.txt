Wilson Antenna

Wilson - who style themselves "The Name in Over the Road Communication" make and distribute a range of Citizen Band (CB) antennas that make for easy radio communication almost anywhere on America's vast road network - and in many other places in the world too.
They are available through a world-wide network of dealerships, distributorships and importers. You can call them on (309) 756-4546 for the name of your nearest Wilson Authorized Dealer anytime Monday through to Friday. Do first check your local time zone for their available hours of assistance, given that Wilson Antenna is on American Central Time.

If you preferred, you could also interrogate the dealer list from the drop-down menu on their user-friendly website, that makes your tackle even easier to find. There are also clicks-through to dealers who have their own sites. However the Wilson list does not include dealers purchasing from distributors near them in order to save on shipping costs.

The site is well constructed, and contains the following tabs:

Base Load Antennas

Base loaded citizen band antennas have their receiver coils located at the bottom of the antenna. Many all-in-one magnet mounted roof antennas are base-loaded in this same way. This provides one of the simplest mounting and installation methods possible. Moreover, base-loaded models use more substantial coils than fiberglass CB antennas too.

On the downside, they are least efficient form of antenna when compared to other load designs. That's because the antenna's coil must be above the highest vehicle surface for optimal performance - providing fewer effective mounting options as a result. This is not to say that the coil load may not be placed below the vehicle's highest surface, although this will be at the cost of performance.

Accordingly, the most popular positions are on car and pick-up truck roofs and trunks.
