The Orange County Convention Center, also referred to as the OCCC is the main convention center of the Central Florida area. It is the second largest convention center in the whole of America. The only center larger is the McCormick Place in Chicago.The Orange County Convention Center covers 7 million feet of floor space, and is located on International Drive, one of the main tourist areas in the state.

The center is owned and operated by Orange County Government. In addition to providing services to event planners, exhibitors and attendees, the OCCC serves the local community promoting economic growth to local businesses. The entire venture, operating costs and expansions, has been paid for by tourist taxes, and not the taxes of the residents of the area. Every year the Orange County Convention Center plays host to more than a million attendees. The center boasts141 meeting rooms and can accommodate anything from a small meeting to a large trade show and has hosted some of the major events in the city, including the Central Florida Auto Show and the Southern Women's Show.

The center was originally named the Orange County Convention and Civic Center or OCCCC. The plan to build the center came about in 1977 when a law was passed by Florida's State Legislature to allow counties to collect a Tourist Development Tax on top of the usual sales taxes on hotel rooms. In April 1978 there was a special election and the voters of Orange County approved this new tax at the 2% level set by the state.The following August, the Orange County Board of County Commissionersapproved the location for the center in Orlando Central Park, on International Drive, and drew up plans for a 325,000 sq ft facility. In 1979, Orlando Central Park and the Orange County Board of County Commissioners struck up a deal where the Orlando Central Park would donate land for the initial facility, and give the county an option on 180,000 m2 for future expansion. Orlando Central Park agreed to commit adjacent lands for hotel and tourist development, with an incentive of one cent per taxed dollar of the Tourist Development Tax every year for 30 years.

In February 1983 and $54 million dollar later, Phase I was complete. 14,000 people attended the Grand Opening and TheBoston Pops Orchestra played.

In June 1984, the Orange County Board of County Commissioners took up the option for the extra 180,000 m2 paying $2 million for it, and began planning Phase II of the development. In 1986 a state law raised the level of the Tourist Development Tax to 3%. and work on Phase II started in February 1987. This work was finished by January 1989; the center now had an additional adding 150,000 sq ftof exhibition space and an extra 100,000 sq ft of meeting and support space.The month of completion also coincided with another raise in the Tourist Development Tax up to 4%. The Orange County Board of County Commissioners approved another three phases in the development of the OCCCC.

Phase IIA saw another 100,000 sq ft added to the center and was completed in December 1990. This extra space was mainly used for offices. In January 1990 planning for Phase III was underway. In December 1992, it was agreed to drop the word "Civic" from the name of the center so it would simply be called the Orange County Convention Center.In January 1996, Phase III was completed which added a further 383,400 sq ft of exhibition space and cost $219.5 million.In August, Phase IV added anther 367,200 sq ft of exhibition space, and 100,000 sq ft of meeting space and cost $198.7 million. In December of 1997 $32 million was spent on a retrofit of Phase I which added a further 8,200 sq ft of space to the center.
